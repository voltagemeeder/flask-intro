So I sort of jumped from lesson 9 to lesson 26 because I wanted to be able to input data into the database from the webpage.  I'm hopefull I can figure that out looking at video #26.  

But I may be able to acomplish the same thing by inputtin the data in manuall using the command prompt.  This will at least allow me to get to the point where I can manipulate things in python and then shuffle them around on the webpage.
